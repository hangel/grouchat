Hey, Streamlit-ers! üëã

My name is *Chanin Nantasenamat, PhD.* I‚Äôm working as a Senior Developer Advocate creating educational content on building Streamlit data apps. In my spare time, I love to create coding and data science tutorials on my YouTube channel, Data Professor.

Are you looking to build an AI-powered chatbot using LLM models but without the heavy API cost? If you answered yes, then keep reading!

You‚Äôll build a chatbot that can generate responses to the user-provided prompt input (i.e., questions) using an open-source, no-cost LLM model OpenAssistant/oasst-sft-6-llama-30b-xor 1 from the unofficial HuggingChat API known as HugChat 2. You‚Äôll deploy the chatbot as a Streamlit app that can be shared with the world!

In this post, you‚Äôll learn how to:

* Set up the app on the Streamlit Community Cloud
* Build the chatbot
